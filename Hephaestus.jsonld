    "objectives": "I have been an avid member of the Cardano community, having been a holder since March 2018. I ran a testnet pool between March-December 2021 before making the jump to mainnet in February 2022 with HEPHY pool. The pool has remained a small, independent pool over the first 2.5 years and so I wanted to participate as a DRep in order to have a more meaningful say in on-chain voting on Cardano.",
